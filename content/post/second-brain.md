# Building a Second Brain - Tiago Forte

Unlike modern readers, who follow the fow of a narrative from beginning to end, early modern 
Englishmen read in fts and  starts and jumped from book to book. They broke texts into fragments and assembled them.

Instead of consuming ever-greater amounts of content, we could take on a more patient, 
thoughtful approach that favors rereading, reformulating, and working through the implications 
of ideas over time. 

However you decide to use it, your Second Brain is a private knowledge collection designed to 
serve a lifetime of learning and growth, not just a single use case. It is a laboratory where you can 
develop and refne your thinking in solitude before sharing it with 
others. A studio where you can experiment with ideas until they are ready to be put to use in the outside world.

As soon as you understand that we naturally use digital tools to extend our thinking beyond the 
bounds of our skulls, you’ll start to see Second Brains everywhere.
A calendar app is an extension of your brain’s ability to remember events, ensuring you never 
forget an appointment. Your smartphone is an extension of your ability to communicate, allowing 
your voice to reach across oceans and continents. Cloud storage is an extension of your brain’s 
memory, allowing you to store thousands of gigabytes and access them from anywhere.*
It’s time to add digital notes to our repertoire and further enhance our natural capabilities using 
technology.

For modern, professional notetaking, a note is a “knowledge building block”—a discrete unit of 
information interpreted through your unique perspective and stored outside your head.

By this defnition, a note could include a passage from a book or article that you were inspired by; 
a photo or image from the web with your annotations; or a bullet-point list of your meandering 
thoughts on a topic, among many other examples. A note could include a single quote from a 
flm that really struck you, all the way to thousands of words you saved from an in-depth book. 
The length and format don’t matter—if a piece of content has been interpreted through your lens, 
curated according to your taste, translated into your own words, or drawn from your life experience, and stored in a secure place, then it qualifes 
as a note.

Until now we’ve talked mostly about gathering the ideas of others, but the ultimate purpose of a 
Second Brain is to allow your own thinking to shine.

We need to adopt the perspective of a curator, stepping back from the raging river and starting 
to make intentional decisions about what information we want to fll our minds.

The best way to organize your notes is to organize for action, according projects you are working on right now. Consider new information in terms of its utility, asking, “How is this going to help me move forward one of my current projects?”

Every time you take a note, ask yourself, “How can I make this as useful as possible for my future 
self?” That question will lead you to annotate the words and phrases that explain why you saved 
a note, what you were thinking, and what exactly caught your of notes, but as a giver of notes—you are giving your future self the gift of knowledge that is easy to fnd and understand.

Notes will be useless if you can’t decipher them in the future, or if they’re so long that you don’t 
even try. Think of yourself not just as a taker

This is why I recommend you shift as much of your time and effort as possible from consuming 
to creating.

Information is always in fux, and it is always a work in progress. Since nothing is ever truly fnal, 
there is no need to wait to get started. You can publish a simple website now, and slowly add additional pages over time. You can send out a draft of a piece of writing now and make 
revisions later when you have more time. The sooner you begin, the sooner you start on the path 
of improvement.

Just as with the food we put into our bodies, it is our responsibility and right to choose our 
information diet. It’s up to us to decide what information is good for us, what we want more of 
and less of, and ultimately, what we do with it. You are what you consume, and that applies just 
as much to information as to nutrition.
A Second Brain gives us a way

In Chapter 2, we looked at the history of commonplace books, kept by intellectuals and writers in previous 
centuries. For them, the purpose of information was clear: to inform their writing, speaking, and 
conversation. Knowing how they were going to be putting ideas to use gave them a powerful lens 
for seeing which ones were worth the trouble of writing

No one else has access to the wisdom you’ve personally gained from a lifetime of conversations, 
mistakes, victories, and lessons learned.

The secret to making reading a habit is to make it effortless and enjoyable.

Each kind of food is organized according to how accessible it needs to be for you to make 
the meals you want to eat.

PARA isn’t a fling system; it’s a production system. It’s no use trying to fnd the “perfect place” 
where a note or fle belongs. There isn’t one. The whole system is constantly shifting and 
changing in sync with your constantly changing life.

Your efforts to capture content for future use will be tremendously easier and more effective if 
you know what that content is for. Using PARA is not just about creating a bunch of folders to put 
things in. It is about identifying the structure of your work and life—what you are committed to, what you want to change, and where you want to go.

To attain knowledge, add things every day. To attain wisdom, remove things every day.
—Lao Tzu, ancient Chinese philosopher

In this sense, notetaking is like time travel—you are sending packets of knowledge through time 
to your future self.

What do you do when communicating with a very busy, very impatient, very important person? 
You distill your message down to the key points and action steps. When you send an email to 
your boss, you don’t bury your request somewhere near the bottom of a massive wall of text. You 
identify the most urgent questions that you need them to respond to right at the top of the email. 
When you’re giving a presentation to the leadership of your organization, you don’t drone on for 
hours. You leave out unnecessary details and get right to the point.

You have to always assume that, until proven otherwise, any given note won’t necessarily ever be 
useful. You have no idea what your future self will need, want, or be working on. This assumption 
forces you to be conservative in the time you spend summarizing notes, doing so only when it’s 
virtually guaranteed that it will be worth it.

The rule of thumb to follow is that every time you “touch” a note, you should make it a little more 
discoverable for your future self* —by adding a highlight, a heading, some bullets, or commentary. This is the “campsite rule” applied to information—leave it better than you found it.

Think about the last time you were entranced by a drawing or painting. Its ability to grab you 
immediately is a sign that the concept behind the artwork is compressed into its most compact 
form, allowing it to travel efciently from the canvas straight into your brain.

If we consider the focused application of our attention to be our greatest asset as knowledge 
workers, we can no longer afford to let that intermediate work disappear. If we consider how 
precious little time we have to produce something extraordinary in our careers, it becomes 
imperative that we recycle that knowledge back into a system where it can become useful again.
What are the knowledge assets you’re creating today that will be most reusable in the future? 

What are the building blocks that will move forward your projects tomorrow? How can you package up what you know in a form that you’ll be able to revisit it again and again no matter what endeavors you take on in the  future?

That system is your Second Brain, and the small pieces of work-in-process it contains I call 
“Intermediate Packets.” Intermediate Packets are the concrete, individual building blocks that 
make up your work.*

Like LEGO blocks, the more pieces you have, the easier it is to build something interesting. 
Imagine that instead of starting your next project with a blank slate, you started with a set of 
building blocks—research fndings, web clippings, PDF highlights, book notes, back-of-theenvelope sketches—that represent your long-term effort to make sense of your feld, your 
industry, and the world at large.

Reframing your productivity in terms of Intermediate Packets is a major step toward this turning 
point. Instead of thinking of your job in terms of tasks
 , which always require you to be there, personally, doing everything yourself, you will start to think in terms of assets and building blocks that you can assemble.

Verum ipsum factum. Translated to English, it means “We only know what we make.”

To truly “know” something, it’s not enough to read about it in a book. Ideas are merely thoughts 
until you put them into action. Thoughts are feeting, quickly fading as time passes. To truly make 
an idea stick, you have to engage with it. You have to get your hands dirty and apply that 
knowledge to a practical problem.

It is when you begin expressing your ideas and turning your knowledge into action that life really 
begins to change. You’ll read differently, becoming more focused on the parts most relevant to 
the argument you’re building. You’ll ask sharper questions, no longer satisfed with vague 
explanations or leaps in logic. You’ll naturally seek venues to show your work, since the feedback 
you receive will propel your thinking forward like nothing else. You’ll begin to act more 
deliberately in your career or business, thinking several steps beyond what you’re consuming to 
consider its ultimate potential.

We can’t expect ourselves to instantly come up with brilliant ideas on demand. I learned that 
innovation and problem-solving depend on a routine that systematically brings interesting ideas 
to the surface of our awareness.*

Chefs use mise en place—a philosophy and mindset embodied in a set of practical techniques—
as their “external brain.”

It gives them a way to externalize their thinking into their environment and automate the 
repetitive parts of cooking so they can focus completely on the creative parts.
We have a lot to learn as knowledge workers.

If at any point you feel overwhelmed, take a step back and focus on what is immediately 
necessary: your most important projects and priorities. Scale back to only the notes you need to 
move those priorities forward. Instead of trying to architect your entire Second Brain system from 
scratch up front, focus on moving one project at a time through each step from capturing to 
expressing. When you do so, you’ll fnd that the steps are much easier and more fexible than you 
imagined.

You can also simplify things by focusing on just one stage of building your Second Brain. Think 
about where you are now and where you want to be in the near future:
Are you hoping to remember more? Focus on developing the practice of capturing and organizing 
your notes according to your projects, commitments, and interests using PARA.
Are you hoping to connect ideas and develop your ability to plan, infuence, and grow in your personal and professional life? Experiment with consistently distilling and refning 
your notes using Progressive Summarization and revisiting them during weekly reviews.
Are you committed to producing more and better output with less frustration and stress? Focus 
on creating one Intermediate Packet at a time and looking for opportunities to share them in ever 
more bold ways.
